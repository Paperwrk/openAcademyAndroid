# Contributing to openAcademy Application

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose 
changes to this document in a pull request.


## Contributions Best Practices
* Write clear meaningful git commit messages (Do read http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
* Always sync the fork repository with base before making any pull requests.
* When you're submitting a PR for a UI-related issue, it would be really awesome if you add a screenshot of your change or a link to a deployment where it can be tested out along with your PR. It makes it very easy for the reviewers and you'll also get reviews quicker.


## Branch Policy

We have the following branches

* **master**
   This contains the stable code. After significant features/bugfixes are accumulated on development, we move it to master.
* **development**
     All development goes on in this branch. If you're making a contribution,
     you are supposed to make a pull request to `development` branch.
